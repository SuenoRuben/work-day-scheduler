# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

I started off with commenting what I will be doing in order to complete the assignment

The first thing I will be working on is being able to put the current day on top of the page. 

The second would be adding timeblocks for "business hours"

Third is going to be able to add times onto the timeblocks and a button in order to save the data

Fourth is make time-blocks color coated red (past), yellow (present), green(future)

last step is to save to local storage in order for the data to be saved and come back to what you have put on the web-page
